# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
This now include course files for peer review of week1
Because my system language is Chinese, the Xlabs in plots have also appeared to be Chinese.
Here are some reference:
* "周四" equals to "Thursday"
* “周五” equals to "Friday"
* “周六” equals to "Saturday"

**Thank you for reviewing my work!**
